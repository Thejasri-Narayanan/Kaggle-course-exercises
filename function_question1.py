# QUESTION - 1 (FUNCTONS) 

# In the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition, you need to use information like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to predict the price of a house. Inspired by this competition, you'll write your own function to do this.

# In the next code cell, create a function get_expected_cost() that has two arguments:

# beds - number of bedrooms
# baths - number of bathrooms
# It should return the expected cost of a house with that number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Assume that:

# the expected cost for a house with 0 bedrooms and 0 bathrooms is 80000.
# each bedroom adds 30000 to the expected cost
# each bathroom adds 10000 to the expected cost.
# For instance,

# a house with 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom has an expected cost of 120000, and
# a house with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom has an expected cost of 150000.

# code : 

def get_expected_cost(beds, baths):
    value = 80000+30000*beds+10000*baths
    return value

beds=int(input())
baths=int(input())
total_value=get_expected_cost(beds,baths)
print(total_value)
