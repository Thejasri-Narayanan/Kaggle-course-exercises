# Question 4
# You work for a company that provides data services. For $100/month, your company provides 15 gigabytes (GB) of data. Then, any additional data is billed at $0.10/MB (or $100/GB, since 1,000 MB are in 1 GB).

# Use the next code cell to write a function get_phone_bill() that takes as input:

# gb = number of GB that the customer used in a month
# It should return the customer's total phone bill.

# For instance:

# A customer who uses 10 GB of data in one month is billed only $100, since the usage stayed under 15 GB. In other words, get_phone_bill(10) should return 100.
# A customer who uses 15.1 GB (or 15 GB + 100 MB) of data in one month has gone over by .1 GB, so they must pay $100 (cost of plan), plus $0.10 * 100 = $10, for a total bill of $110. In other words, get_phone_bill(15.1) should return 110.
# Do not round your answer.

# code:

def get_phone_bill(gb):
    if gb<=15:
        bill = 100
    else:
        bill=100+(gb-15)*100
    return bill
