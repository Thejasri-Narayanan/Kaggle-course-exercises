# Question 4
# Use the get_cost() function you defined in Question 3 to calculate the cost of applying one coat of paint to a room with:

# 432 square feet of walls, and
# 144 square feet of ceiling.
# Assume that one gallon of paint covers 400 square feet and costs $15. As in Question 3, assume you can buy partial gallons of paint. Do not round your answer.

# code: (continuous to question 3)

project_cost = get_cost(432,144,400,15)
print(project_cost)
