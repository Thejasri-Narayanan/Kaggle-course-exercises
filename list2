# Question 2
# The list num_customers contains the number of customers who came into your restaurant every day over the last month (which lasted thirty days). Fill in values for each of the following:

# avg_first_seven - average number of customers who visited in the first seven days
# avg_last_seven - average number of customers who visited in the last seven days
# max_month - number of customers on the day that got the most customers in the last month
# min_month - number of customers on the day that got the least customers in the last month
# Answer this question by writing code. For instance, if you have to find the minimum value in a list, use min() instead of scanning for the smallest value and directly filling in a number.
