# You are a programmer at a water agency. Recently, you have been tasked to write a function get_water_bill() that takes as input:

# num_gallons = the number of gallons of water that a customer used that month. (This will always be an integer with no decimal part.)
# It should output the water bill.

# The water agency uses this pricing structure:

# Tier	Amount in gallons	Price per 1000 gallons
# Tier 1	0 - 8,000	$5
# Tier 2	8,001 - 22,000	$6
# Tier 3	22,001 - 30,000	$7
# Tier 4	30,001+	$10
# For example:

# Someone who uses 10,000 gallons of water in a month is placed in Tier 2, and needs to pay a water bill of $6 * 10 = $60. In other words, get_water_bill(10000) should return 60.0.
# Someone who uses 25,000 gallons of water in a month is placed in Tier 3, and needs to pay a water bill of $7 * 25 = $175. In other words, get_water_bill(25000) should return 175.0.
# Do not round your answer. So, your answer might return fractions of a penny.

# code:

def get_water_bill(num_gallons):
    if num_gallons <= 8000:
        bill = 5*(num_gallons/1000)
    elif num_gallons <= 22000 and num_gallons >= 8001:
        bill = 6*(num_gallons/1000)
    elif num_gallons <=30000 and num_gallons >= 22001:
        bill = 7*(num_gallons/1000)
    else:
        bill = 10*(num_gallons/1000)
    return bill
